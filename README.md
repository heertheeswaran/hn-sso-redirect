Hellonext uses its own authentication mechanism to either log users in or create an user account. If you want to override this to use your own authentication system, follow the instructions on "[Understanding SSO Redirects](https://hellonext.co/help/sso-redirects)".

Use the code samples present in this repository to setup your custom redirect application.
